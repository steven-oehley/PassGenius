# KeyGenius 🔐

<hr>

KeyGenius is a web app created with HTML, CSS and JS.
It gives the user an option to generate up to 8 passwords at a time,
each of a length of 15 characters.

The user has further options to incorporate or exclude number and symbols from their password.

The app allows users to copy passwords on click, for easier use.

The list of symbols, numbers and characters are chosen at random.
These are then combined into a single array and shuffled to produce a password.
